Reflection
 

// Your reflection goes here
 
In today session we were introduced to git/github, we were shown a quick demo on the advantages using vscode. We installed an extension onto vscode. We have done an intro demo of how to commit changes in files to a repo that we cloned onto our machine.


2.2 - 27/10/2020

During this lesson we learnt about applying CSS and how it loads in a browser. I've added a couple of notes below as a reminder:


IDs are for anything that is only used in a webpage once ie header, footer

Lots of elements can have the same class 


Inline and Blocks
A block-level HTML element will always create a new line after the closing tag, whereas an inline HTML element will not. ... So, no matter how you organize your HTML, block-level elements always create a new line. With an inline element, there is never a new line.

Divs - division of code. These can be used a lot to set up classes for different elements

2.3 29/10/2020

Span tag is good for inline divisions instead of the div element which is sections. 

pseudo-classes are used to add special effects 

selection:pseudo-class {
    property:value;

}

a:link {
    text-decoration:none;
}
