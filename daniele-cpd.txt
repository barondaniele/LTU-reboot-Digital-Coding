Reflection
 

// Your reflection goes here
 
In today session we were introduced to git/github, we were shown a quick demo on the advantages using vscode. We installed an extension onto vscode. We have done an intro demo of how to commit changes in files to a repo that we cloned onto our machine.


2.2 - 27/10/2020

During this lesson we learnt about applying CSS and how it loads in a browser. I've added a couple of notes below as a reminder:


IDs are for anything that is only used in a webpage once ie header, footer

Lots of elements can have the same class 


Inline and Blocks
A block-level HTML element will always create a new line after the closing tag, whereas an inline HTML element will not. ... So, no matter how you organize your HTML, block-level elements always create a new line. With an inline element, there is never a new line.

Divs - division of code. These can be used a lot to set up classes for different elements

************************************************************

2.3 29/10/2020

Span tag is good for inline divisions instead of the div element which is sections. 

pseudo-classes are used to add special effects 

selection:pseudo-class {
    property:value;

}

a:link {
    text-decoration:none;
}

Alex referenced pseudo code which would be useful to look up

Introduction to JS. You can comment in JS by using // and it's important to explain things

We learnt how to bring a pop up when the browser loads a document and how to write to the console

We also learnt about variables in taks 3.1.3

strings: string of characters
var userName = 'Jack Pott';

Number integar or floating point
var myAge = 32;

boolean true or false 
var catsAreBest = true;

undefined value (hasn't been defined)
var favoriteThings;

null an explicity empty value
var goodPickupLines = null;


You can't times a string by something. You get NaN return in console.

modulus is when the number is divided by another number then what's the remainder? ie 10 divided by 3 is 1 remaining

\ is an escape when using strings so you'd do 'I\'d like to do this string'

You can set variables to strings ie var firstMessage = 'This is the message';

            var firstName = 'Daniele';
          var lastName = 'Baron';
          console.log(firstName + ' ' + lastName);


          Learnt about cancata

************************************************************

3.2 10/11/20

functions are names followed by ()

Functions can only be evoked below the declaration

You should prefix the data type str, bln etc 

when you're calling an argument it goes in ()


We learnt about Global and Local variables

Global are set outside the function and local variables are set inside a function.

variables inside a function are specific to that function so can have the same name

We should aim to write code so a non-coder can understand it. Name things so it makes sense

We learnt about booleans

== is Equals
=== is identical to
!= not equal
!== Not identical

12/11/20    

Switch statements - look these up. Alex loves them.

Always deal with the logic you need high up in the document

All functions 
************************************************************

17/11/20

loops - different while, for, for each 

Loops executes code a number of times

++ means take this variable and add one to it

for loop - first bit set variable, second is the logic and third is the function

break statements don't work in if or if else statements

strMessage is good to use 

document.write publishes to the page
